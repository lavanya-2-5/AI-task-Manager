# AI-Powered Task Management System

This project uses NLP and ML to classify, prioritize, and assign tasks automatically based on behavior, workload, and deadlines.

## 📁 Project Structure
- data/: Raw and cleaned task datasets
- eda/: Exploratory Data Analysis notebooks
- nlp/: Preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords, stemming)
- features/: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings
- models/: Task classification models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- evaluations/: Metrics and evaluation results

## 🧠 Models Used
- Naive Bayes, SVM
- Random Forest, XGBoost (for priority prediction)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, gensim)
- Git + GitHub

## 📈 Mid-Project Deliverables
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Trained and evaluated task classifier
- EDA visualizations
- Code organized in branches and folders
